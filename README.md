## Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Run ```npm install``` in the top-level of the project directory.

## Key Features

* The product list view can be filtered to display items of a specific category
* Product quantity dropdowns reflect actual available inventory (default for all products is 5)
* Products with no inventory in stock cannot be added to the cart
* If a product is in the cart, the quantity in the cart is reflected in the product list
* The "Cart" link in the header reflects the current quantity of total items in the cart
* From the checkout screen, clicking "Confirm Purchase" clears the cart, but the inventory quantities of all items persist
